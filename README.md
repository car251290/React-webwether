How to create a Website using React.

A simple website that I made using js and React, using the components of the website to show images and go to the links, basics concepts that can be useful at the moment to make a responsive website.

#Add React to a Website You can add React to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.

#JavaScript Resources The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time.

#React and Web Components are built to solve different problems. Web Components provide strong encapsulation for reusable components, while React provides a declarative library that keeps the DOM in sync with your data. The two goals are complementary. As a developer, you are free to use React in your Web Components or to use Web Components in React, or both.
